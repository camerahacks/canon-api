On February 2019, Canon released the official CCAPI which allows tinkerers, hackers, and developers to create software that interacts with Canon cameras using a web API.

Cameras supporting the API:
- Canon EOS RP
- Canon PowerShot SX70 HS
- Canon EOS Rebel SL3

The API can be used to change camera settings, control the camera, and retrieve pictures.

This Coldfusion(CFML) repository is a work in progress. The goal is to create wireless tools to operate any Canon camera that supports the CCAPI.
